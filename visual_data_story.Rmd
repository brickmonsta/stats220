## Road to strong man.
This is a analysis on my Push-up journey where every time I completed a set of push-ups, I logged it with a Google survey and published it into a google spreadsheet.

data was collected over two weeks which are approximately one month apart where I had completed and logged 42 sets of push-ups.
## Does difficulty correlate to more reps?
Ordered from lowest to highest median reps, it seems that at difficulty 4, I often did the most reps.

The hardest difficulty median reps completed is actually in the middle significantly lower than difficulty 2. When we look at the variation however, difficulty 5 has much more variation compared to the others. This is largely due to the variant of pus-hup where the harder variants become much harder much quicker.

## Have I improved over time?
Looking at all the data, it seems that yes, I have improved in the second week.
![](plot2.png)
The trend is much steeper with the alternative variants to the normal push up. This could be due to me getting used to the different variants where I get much better the more often I do it. But as you can see, the normal didn't improve that much. This sort of indicates to me that the amount you do for every variant over time is a bit of a log curve where you do a lot at when you first learn but after that you only get slightly better.

## Looking a bit closer
Compared to the overall data, it seems that the last week, I had gotten worse?
![](plot3.png)
Looking at this data, we see that we actually got worse overtime in the last week. Data collection was actually going well at the start but during the week I had gotten sick so it became diffucult to complete more reps.

## Does the hour of the day matter?

The data appears to not really have a trend where I was quite consistent with the amount push-ups completed at any time of the day.
![](plot4.png)
There doesn't seem to be any data to suggest that if I do push-ups in the morning vs afternoon, I would be able to rep more.

## In Conclusion

From this experience, I was able to learn that I need to complete more push-ups. Its as simple as that, to get better at push-ups I just need to do more push-ups and with proper form, I can do even more.
