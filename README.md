# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in a conjoint in BA stats and BSC computer science.
- I am taking STATS 220 because it's a prerequisite course for a stage three course I want to take.
- I am interested in learning about both programming and stats work together to produce an outcome.

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![]([https://c.tenor.com/8druEACXtX8AAAAd/tenor.gif](https://tenor.com/view/disintegrating-funny-thanos-gif-22399978))
