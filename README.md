# stats220

## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

### A little about me:

* I am undertaking a degree in a conjoint in BA stats and BSC computer science.
* I am taking STATS 220 because it's a prerequisite course for a stage three course I want to take.
* I am interested in learning about both programming and stats work together to produce an outcome.

### A little more about me:

I really enjoy listening to music and my top three favorite artists are:

1. *Kendrick Lamar*
2. *Daniel Caesar*
3. *SZA*

An activity I like doing often is playing chess on **[chess.com](chess.com)**.
Despite all the games I play and puzzles I do, I still fall for the **backrank mate** and when I do, this is how I feel.
