# stats220

## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

### A little about me:

* I am undertaking a **conjoint degree** in **BA Statistics** and **BSc Computer Science**.
* I am taking *STATS 220* because it's a prerequisite course for a stage three course I want to take.
* I am interested in learning how both **programming** and **statistics** work together to produce an outcome.

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is
