# stats220

## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

### A little about me:

* I am undertaking a degree in a conjoint in BA stats and BSC computer science.
* I am taking STATS 220 because it's a prerequisite course for a stage three course I want to take.
* I am interested in learning about both programming and stats work together to produce an outcome.
